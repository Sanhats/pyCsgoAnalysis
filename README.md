We are going to use the CS:GO dataset to build a machine learning model, which predicts the winner of a round given the currently available information.

Dataset: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=43430&status=active


We extract attributes and data for further processing.

We then use different ways to classify the data obtained from our dataset.

The conclusion was to obtain a match rate of 83% using random forest 
classification versus 75% using neural network classification with tensorflow.
